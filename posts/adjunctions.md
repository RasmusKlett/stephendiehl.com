### From Adjunctions to Monads

I thought I would share one of my favorite constructions in
Haskell, namely that adjoint functors give rise to monads.
Although it's a trivial result in category theory how it
manifests in Haskell is quite lovely.

A Functor in Haskell maps objects and morphism (i.e. functions)
in a subcategory of *Hask* to objects and morphisms of another
category.

```haskell
class Functor f where
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

And satisfies the functor laws:

```haskell
fmap id = id
fmap (a . b) = (fmap a) . (fmap b)
```

In commutative diagrams we draw objects as points and morphisms
as arrows. In a string diagrams we invert this and draw morphisms
as points and objects as lines.

Functor composition is defined for $F : \mathcal{A} \rightarrow
\mathcal{B}$, $G : \mathcal{B} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}$ as $G
\circ F : \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}$, and is drawn with
parallel lines.

```haskell
newtype FComp f g a = C { unC :: f (g a) }

instance (Functor f, Functor g) => Functor (FComp f g) where
  fmap f (C x) = C (fmap (fmap f) x)
```

<p>

</p>

Generally the composition of functors $F \circ G$ is written
simply as $FG$. Composition diagrammatically allows us to
collapse adjacent segments in our string diagram.

The identity functor ( $\text{Id}$ ) is the functor that maps
each morphism and object to itself.

```haskell
newtype Id a = Identity { unId :: a }

instance Functor Id where
    fmap f x = Identity (f (unId x))
```

Composition with the identity functor forms an identity relation:

$$
F \circ \text{Id}_B = F \\
\text{Id}_A \circ F = F
$$

As witnessed by the expressions:

```haskell
left :: Functor f => FComp f Id a -> f a
left (C a) = fmap unId a

right :: Functor f => f a -> FComp f Id a
right a = C $ fmap Identity a
```

We'll follow the convention to omit the identity functor, and it is shown as a dotted line in subsequent
string diagrams.

A natural transformation in our context will be a polymorphic function
associated with two Haskell functor instances ``f`` and ``g`` with type
signature ``(Functor f, Functor g) => forall a. f a -> g a``. Which could be written with
the following type synonym.

```haskell
type Nat f g = forall a. f a -> g a
```

<p>
<img src="/images/string5.png"/>
</p>

The identity natural transform mapping a functor $F$ to itself is
written $1_F$ and in Haskell is just (``id``). The composition of
natural transformations follows the associativity laws, shown
below:

<p>
<img src="/images/string13.png"/>
</p>

The final *interchange law* states that we can chase the natural
transformations through the functors horizontally or compose
natural transformation between functors vertically and still
arrive at the same result.

$$
(\alpha \beta) \circ (\alpha' \beta') = (\alpha \alpha') \circ (\beta \beta')
$$

```haskell
type NatComp f f' g g' = forall a. f' (f a) -> g' (g a)

vert :: (Functor f, Functor f', Functor g, Functor g') =>
         Nat f' g' -> Nat f g -> NatComp f f' g g'
vert a b x = a (fmap b x)

horiz :: (Functor f, Functor f', Functor g, Functor g') =>
          Nat f' g' -> Nat f g -> NatComp f f' g g'
horiz a b x = fmap b (a x)
```

By the interchange law ``horiz`` and ``vert`` must be
interchangable under composition. For natural transformations
``a, b, a', b'`` in Haskell we have the equation:

```haskell
(a . b) `vert` (a' . b') == (a `horiz` a') . (b `horiz` b')
```

A diagram example for a natural transformation $\eta : 1_\mathcal{C}
\rightarrow {FG}$ between the identity functor and the
composition functor of $FG$ would be drawn as:

An isomorphism $F \cong G$ implies that composition of functors
is invertible in that $F G = \text{Id}_C$ and $G F =
\text{Id}_D$. An adjoint $F ⊣ G$ between a pair of functors $F :
D \rightarrow C$ and $G : C \rightarrow D$ is a weaker statement
that there exists a pair of associated natural transformations
$(F, G, \epsilon, \eta)$ with:

$$
\epsilon : FG \rightarrow 1_\mathcal{C} \\
\eta : 1_\mathcal{D} \rightarrow FG
$$

<p>
<img src="/images/string8.png"/>
</p>

Such that the following *triangle identities* hold:

$$
(\epsilon F) \circ (F \eta) = 1_F  \\
(G \epsilon) \circ (\eta G) = 1_G 
$$

These are drawn below:

</p>

In terms of the categories $C,D$ an adjoint is in some sense a
"half-isomorphism" or "almost inverse" but some structure is lost
in one direction.

$\eta$ and $\epsilon$ are also referred to respectively as the
*unit* and *counit*.

In Haskell we have the following typeclass which unfortunately
requires a functional dependency in order for type inferencer to
deduce which ``fmap`` is to be used:

```haskell
class (Functor f, Functor g) => Adjoint f g | f -> g, g -> f where
  eta     :: a -> g (f a)
  epsilon :: f (g a) -> a
```

There are also two other natural transformations ($\phi, \psi$)
which together with the adjoint functor pair form an
*adjunction*.  The adjunction can be defined in terms of the
adjoint pair and this is most convenient definition in Haskell

$$
\psi \epsilon = 1_F \\
\phi \eta = 1_G 
$$

```haskell
phi :: Adjoint f g => (f a -> b) -> a -> g b
phi f = fmap f . eta

psi :: Adjoint f g => (a -> g b) -> f a -> b
psi f = epsilon . fmap f
```

Notably $\phi$ and $\psi$ form an isomorphism between the set of
functions ``(a -> g b)`` and ``(f a -> b)`` which is the same
relation as the above triangle identities. Alternatively $\eta$
and $\epsilon$ can be expressed in terms of $\phi$ and $\psi$.

```haskell
phi eta = id
psi epsilon = id 
```

***

From the Haskell Prelude we have the canonical adjoint namely
``curry`` and ``uncurry``:

$$
\text{curry} \quad ⊣ \quad \text{uncurry}
$$

```haskell
instance Functor ((,) a) where
  fmap f (x,y) = (x, f y)

instance Functor ((->) a) where
  fmap f g = \x -> f (g x)
```

Which we can construction an Adjoint instance from these two
functor instances:

```haskell
instance Adjoint ((,) a) ((->) a) where
  eta x y = (y, x)
  epsilon (y, f) = f y
```

We can check that the triangle equalities hold for this
definition by showing both $(\epsilon F) \circ (F \eta)$ and $(G
\epsilon) \circ (\eta G)$ reduce to the identity natural
transformation  ( ``id`` ).

```haskell
a0 :: (a -> (b -> c)) -> a -> (b -> c)
a0 f = \f -> fmap (epsilon . fmap f) . eta
a0 f = fmap (\(y, f) -> g f y) . eta
a0 f = \x y -> f x y

a1 :: ((a, b) -> c) -> (a,b) -> c
a1 f = epsilon . fmap (fmap f . eta)
a1 f = epsilon . fmap (\x y -> f (y, x))
a1 f = \(x, y) -> f (x, y)
```


***

We know a Monad is an endofunctor $T : C \rightarrow C$ with two
natural transformations $(T, \mu, \eta)$ with the usual laws:

$$
\mu \circ T \mu = \mu \circ \mu T \\
\mu \circ T \eta = \mu \circ \eta T = 1_T \\
$$

<p>
<img src="/images/string3.png"/>
</p>

The geometric intuition is that the monad laws are reflected as
topological properties of the string diagrams. Both $\mu$ and
$\eta$ exhibit reflection symmetry and that we topologically
straighten out $\eta$ to yield the identity functor.

In Haskell we can [normally
construct](http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/monads.html) the
Monad type class from an Endofunctor and ($\mu, \eta$) or
``join`` and ``return``.

```haskell
class (Functor t) => Monad t where
  eta :: a -> (t a)
  mu  :: (t (t a)) -> (t a)

  (>>=) :: t a -> (a -> t b) -> t b
  ma >>= f = mu . fmap f

return = eta
join = mu
```

What is not immediately apparent though is that every adjoint
pair of functors gives rise to a monad $(T, \mu, \eta)$ over a
category $C$ induced by the composition of the functors to give
rise to a endofunctor and natural transformations in terms of the
unit and counit of the underlying adjunction:

$$
\begin{align}
T &= G \circ F & : &C \rightarrow C  \\
\mu &= G \epsilon & : &T^2 \rightarrow T \\
\end{align}
$$

```haskell
class Adjoint f g => Monad f g where
  muM :: g (f (g (f a))) -> g (f a)
  muM = fmap epsilon

  etaM :: a -> g (f a)
  etaM = eta

  (>>=) :: g (f a) -> (a -> g (f b)) -> g (f b)
  x >>= f = muM (fmap (fmap f) x)
```

The geometric intution for this is clear:

<p>
<img src="/images/string11.png"/>
</p>

From the Monad we can then construct the Kleisli category in the
usual way.

```haskell
class (Adjoint f g, Category c) => Kleisli c f g where
  idK :: c x (g (f x))
  (<=<) :: c y (g (f z)) -> c x (g (f y)) -> c x (g (f z))

instance Monad f g => Kleisli (->) f g where
  idK = eta
  g <=< f = muM . fmap (fmap g) . f

instance Kleisli c f g => Monoid (c a (g (f a))) where
  mempty  = idK
  mappend = (<=<)
```

In retrospect this is trivial, but importantly leads us to the
more important question: Can we recover an adjunction from a
monad.  The answer is Yes...
